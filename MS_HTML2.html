    <h3 >The recent <strong>Global Climate Change Summit</strong> concluded with world leaders committing to <em>ambitious environmental policies</em>. The summit, held in Geneva, saw participation from over 100 countries, each pledging to take substantial actions to mitigate the effects of climate change.Technologies that we use to address climate change are known as climate technologies. Climate technologies that help us reduce GHGs include renewable energies such as wind energy, solar power and hydropower. To adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, we use climate technologies such as drought-resistant crops, early warning systems and sea walls. There are also ‘soft’ climate technologies, such as energy-efficient practices or training for using equipment.The primary objective of the Summit was to encourage the world’s major economies—and especially the original members of the Major Economies Forum on Climate and Energy, which together represent 80 percent of global emissions and 80 percent of global GDP—to enhance ambition to keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. To ensure the Summit captured as many diverse viewpoints as possible, the United States invited additional countries that are key voices in the climate fight—for example, some that are especially vulnerable to climate impacts or that are charting particularly innovative pathways to a net-zero economy.Discussing opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change, address the global security challenges posed by climate change and the impact on readiness, and address the role of nature-based solutions in achieving net zero by 2050 goals.</h3><br>
    <h3>Some of the key agreements reached during the summit include:</h3>
    <ol>
    <h3>
        <li>Reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2030.Galvanizing efforts by the world’s major economies to reduce emissions during this critical decade to keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius within reach.</li>
        <li>Investing in renewable energy sources.Mobilizing public and private sector finance to drive the net-zero transition and to help vulnerable countries cope with climate impacts.</li>
        <li>The economic benefits of climate action, with a strong emphasis on job creation, and the importance of ensuring all communities and workers benefit from the transition to a new clean energy economy.</li>
        <li>Bringing transformational technologies that can help reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, while also creating enormous new economic opportunities and building the industries of the future</li>
        <li>Protecting biodiversity through new conservation efforts.Showcasing subnational and non-state actors that are committed to green recovery and an equitable vision for limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius, and are working closely with national governments to advance ambition and resilience</li>
